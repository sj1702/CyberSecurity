## ISC2 Code of Ethics
#Code
All information security professionals who are certified by ISC2 recognize that such certification is a privilege that must be both earned and maintained. In support of this principle, all ISC2 members are required to commit to fully support this Code of Ethics (the "Code"). ISC2 members who intentionally or knowingly violate any provision of the Code will be subject to action by a peer review panel, which may result in the revocation of certification. ISC2 members are obligated to follow the ethics complaint procedure upon observing any action by an ISC2 member that breach the Code. Failure to do so may be considered a breach of the Code pursuant to Canon IV. 

There are only four mandatory canons in the Code. By necessity, such high-level guidance is not intended to be a substitute for the ethical judgment of the professional.
