Monitoring:::
The use of physical access controls and monitoring personnel and equipment entering and leaving as well as auditing/logging all physical events are primary elements in maintaining overall organizational security. 

Monitoring Examples::

Alarm Systems:
Alarm systems are commonly found on doors and windows in homes and office buildings. In their simplest form, they are designed to alert the appropriate personnel when a door or window is opened unexpectedly.

For example, an employee may enter a code and/or swipe a badge to open a door, and that action would not trigger an alarm. Alternatively, if that same door was opened by brute force without someone entering the correct code or using an authorized badge, an alarm would be activated.

Another alarm system is a fire alarm, which may be activated by heat or smoke at a sensor and will likely sound an audible warning to protect human lives in the vicinity. It will likely also contact local response personnel as well as the closest fire department.

Finally, another common type of alarm system is in the form of a panic button. Once activated, a panic button will alert the appropriate police or security personnel.

Cameras:
Cameras are normally integrated into the overall security program and centrally monitored. Cameras provide a flexible method of surveillance and monitoring. They can be a deterrent to criminal activity, can detect activities if combined with other sensors and, if recorded, can provide evidence after the activity They are often used in locations where access is difficult or there is a need for a forensic record.

While cameras provide one tool for monitoring the external perimeter of facilities, other technologies augment their detection capabilities. A variety of motion sensor technologies can be effective in exterior locations. These include infrared, microwave and lasers trained on tuned receivers. Other sensors can be integrated into doors, gates and turnstiles, and strain-sensitive cables and other vibration sensors can detect if someone attempts to scale a fence. Proper integration of exterior or perimeter sensors will alert an organization to any intruders attempting to gain access across open space or attempting to breach the fence line.


Logs:
In this section, we are concentrating on the use of physical logs, such as a sign-in sheet maintained by a security guard, or even a log created by an electronic system that manages physical access. Electronic systems that capture system and security logs within software will be covered in another section.

A log is a record of events that have occurred. Physical security logs are essential to support business requirements. They should capture and retain information as long as necessary for legal or business reasons. Because logs may be needed to prove compliance with regulations and assist in a forensic investigation, the logs must be protected from manipulation. Logs may also contain sensitive data about customers or users and should be protected from unauthorized disclosure.

The organization should have a policy to review logs regularly as part of their organization’s security program. As part of the organization’s log processes, guidelines for log retention must be established and followed. If the organizational policy states to retain standard log files for only six months, that is all the organization should have.

A log anomaly is anything out of the ordinary. Identifying log anomalies is often the first step in identifying security-related issues, both during an audit and during routine monitoring. Some anomalies will be glaringly obvious: for example, gaps in date/time stamps or account lockouts. Others will be harder to detect, such as someone trying to write data to a protected directory. Although it may seem that logging everything so you would not miss any important data is the best approach, most organizations would soon drown under the amount of data collected.

Business and legal requirements for log retention will vary among economies, countries and industries. Some businesses will have no requirements for data retention. Others are mandated by the nature of their business or by business partners to comply with certain retention data. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires that businesses retain one year of log data in support of PCI. Some federal regulations include requirements for data retention as well.

If a business has no business or legal requirements to retain log data, how long should the organization keep it? The first people to ask should be the legal department. Most legal departments have very specific guidelines for data retention, and those guidelines may drive the log retention policy.


Security Guards:
Security guards are an effective physical security control. No matter what form of physical access control is used, a security guard or other monitoring system will discourage a person from masquerading as someone else or following closely on the heels of another to gain access. This helps prevent theft and abuse of equipment or information.
