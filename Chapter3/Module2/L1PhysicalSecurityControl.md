What Are Physical Security Controls? 
Physical access controls are items you can physically touch. They include physical mechanisms deployed to prevent, monitor, or detect direct contact with systems or areas within a facility. Examples of physical access controls include security guards, fences, motion detectors, locked doors/gates, sealed windows, lights, cable protection, laptop locks, badges, swipe cards, guard dogs, cameras, mantraps/turnstiles, and alarms.

Physical access controls are necessary to protect the assets of a company, including its most important asset, people. When considering physical access controls, the security of the personnel always comes first, followed by securing other physical assets.

Why Have Physical Security Controls?
Physical access controls include fences, barriers, turnstiles, locks and other features that prevent unauthorized individuals from entering a physical site, such as a workplace. This is to protect not only physical assets such as computers from being stolen, but also to protect the health and safety of the personnel inside.
