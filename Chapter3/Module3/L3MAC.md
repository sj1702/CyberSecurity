Mandatory Access Control (MAC):
A mandatory access control (MAC) policy is one that is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of an information system. In simplest terms, this means that only properly designated security administrators, as trusted subjects, can modify any of the security rules that are established for subjects and objects within the system. This also means that for all subjects defined by the organization (that is, known to its integrated identity management and access control system), the organization assigns a subset of total privileges for a subset of objects, such that the subject is constrained from doing any of the following:

Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects 
Granting its privileges to other subjects 
Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system or system components 
Choosing the security attributes to be associated with newly created or modified objects 
Changing the rules governing access control 
Although MAC sounds very similar to DAC, the primary difference is who can control access. With Mandatory Access Control, it is mandatory for security administrators to assign access rights or permissions; with Discretionary Access Control, it is up to the object ownerâ€™s discretion. 

MAC in the Workplace:
Mandatory access control is also determined by the owner of the assets, but on a more across-the-board basis, with little individual decision-making about who gets access.  

For example, at certain government agencies, personnel must have a certain type of security clearance to get access to certain areas. In general, this level of access is set by government policy and not by an individual giving permission based on their own judgment.  

Often this is accompanied by separation of duties, where your scope of work is limited and you do not have access to see information that does not concern you; someone else handles that information. This separation of duties is also facilitated by role-based access control, as we will discuss next.
