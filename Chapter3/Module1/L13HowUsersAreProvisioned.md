How Users Are Provisioned
Other situations that call for provisioning new user accounts or changing privileges include: 

A new employee—When a new employee is hired, the hiring manager sends a request to the security administrator to create a new user ID. This request authorizes creation of the new ID and provides instructions on appropriate access levels. Additional authorization may be required by company policy for elevated permissions. 
Change of position—When an employee has been promoted, their permissions and access rights might change as defined by the new role, which will dictate any added privileges and updates to access. At the same time, any access that is no longer needed in the new job will be removed. 
Separation of employment—When employees leave the company, depending on company policy and procedures, their accounts must be disabled after the termination date and time. It is recommended that accounts be disabled for a period before they are deleted to preserve the integrity of any audit trails or files that may be owned by the user. Since the account will no longer be used, it should be removed from any security roles or additional access profiles. This protects the company, so the separated employee is unable to access company data after separation, and it also protects them because their account cannot be used by others to access data.
NOTE: Upon hiring or changing roles, a best practice is to not copy user profiles to new users, because this promotes “permission or privilege creep.” For example, if an employee is given additional access to complete a task and that access is not removed when the task is completed, and then that user’s profile is copied to create a new user ID, the new ID is created with more permissions than are needed to complete their functions. It is recommended that standard roles are established, and new users are created based on those standards rather than an actual user.

Tasha: Whether a user is authorized or unauthorized depends on their user provisioning, which is an identity management process for creating and managing access to resources and information systems. Manny: While we usually think of user provisioning as creating new accounts, there are several different situations which require action by a security administrator who is responsible for provisioning user accounts. Tasha: In fact, Susan finds herself in a situation that requires changes to a user’s provisioning. Let's check in with her as she notifies the security administrator of this change.  Susan is talking to her security administrator. Susan: One of my employees will be taking a temporary leave of absence. Dimitra, she’s going to be taking a sabbatical from work and she’s not going to need access to the systems Manny: Since Dimitra will not be accessing the systems, the security admin recommends disabling her accounts while she is not at work. This reduces the risk that her account could be used by an unauthorized person while she is on leave. He tells Susan to make the request, and then, according to the company policy and procedures, he will disable Dimitra's login account, so she is not allowed to log in to the company systems while out on leave. Susan: So, will this make things complicated when Dimitra returns to work? Oh, I see. Even though the account is disabled, but not otherwise modified, it will be easy to reactivate it once she returns. That's great news, because I’m going to need her up and running as soon as she gets back.

Compare and Contrast a Regular User Account to a Privileged User Account.

A Privileged User Account: 
 -Has access to interact directly with servers and other infrastructure devices.
 -Should require the use of MFA.
 -Uses the most stringent access control.
 -Has the highest level of logging associated with actions.
 -Often has the ability to create users and assign permissions.

A Regular User Account:
 -Has access to log on only to authorized workstations.
 -Is most likely to have read-only access to a database.
 -Has access levels that are typically needed for daily business operations.
 -Has the lowest level of logging associated with actions.
