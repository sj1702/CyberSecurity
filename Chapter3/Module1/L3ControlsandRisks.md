Narrator: A control serves to reduce the risk to where it is within the risk tolerance of the individual or organization. A physical control would be a seat belt. An administrative control would be a law requiring the use of the seatbelt. Both of these serve to reduce the risk of driving to a degree that is acceptable to the driver and to society.  Another non-technical example is that of a tall bookshelf. Since there is a risk of a tall bookshelf toppling over and possibly hurting someone, many local building codes or regulations require bookshelves to be secured to a wall using a strap or a bracket. In this case, the risk is the injury to people. A logical control is the building code, and the actual attachment of the shelf to the wall is the physical control. Both logical and physical controls work together to mitigate the risk.
