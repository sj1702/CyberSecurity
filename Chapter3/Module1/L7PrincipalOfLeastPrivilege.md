Tasha: Gabriela is a recent new hire at JavaSip, and she's reached out to Nate for some help.  Gabriela: Hey Nate?  Nate: Yep? Gabriela: I accidentally submitted my timecard already, and I can't get into the payroll system to fix it.  Nate: Well, of course you canâ€™t get into the system. Only the manager, that's me, can get into the payroll system. Otherwise, we'd risk everyone giving themselves raises, not to mention having access to other employees' confidential information. Here, let me show you. There it is. Gabriela: Oh. Yeah. Nate: All good.  Gabriela: Thanks! Nate: Welcome. Tasha: Nate explains to Gabriela that her access to the system is limited by her role. She doesn't have the proper permissions to make changes to her timecard, just to complete and submit it. That's all she needs to do in her position, so she is restricted from other functions in the system, but he's happy to help and reassures Gabriela that he will make the necessary changes.
