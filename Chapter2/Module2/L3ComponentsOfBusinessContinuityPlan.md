Components of a Business Continuity Plan
Business continuity planning (BCP) is the proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster or other significant disruption to the organization. Members from across the organization should participate in creating the BCP to ensure all systems, processes and operations are accounted for in the plan.

The term business is used often, as this is mostly a business function as opposed to a technical one. However, in order to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, the technology must align with the business needs.

Here are some common components of a comprehensive business continuity plan:

List of the BCP team members, including multiple contact methods and backup members
Immediate response procedures and checklists (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.)
Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted
Guidance for management, including designation of authority for specific managers
How/when to enact the plan
Contact numbers for critical members of the supply chain (vendors, customers, possible external emergency providers, third-party partners)
