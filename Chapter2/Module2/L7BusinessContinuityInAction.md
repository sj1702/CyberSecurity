Business Continuity in Action
What does business continuity look like in action?

Imagine that the billing department of a company suffers a complete loss in a fire. The fire occurred overnight, so no personnel were in the building at the time. A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) was performed four months ago and identified the functions of the billing department as very important to the company, but not immediately affecting other areas of work. Through a previously signed agreement, the company has an alternative area in which the billing department can work, and it can be available in less than one week. Until that area can be fully ready, customer billing inquiries will be answered by customer service staff. The billing department personnel will remain in the alternate working area until a new permanent area is available.

In this scenario, the BIA already identified the dependencies of customer billing inquiries and revenue. Because the company has ample cash reserves, a week without billing is acceptable during this interruption to normal business. Pre-planning was realized by having an alternate work area ready for the personnel and having the customer service department handle the billing department’s calls during the transition to temporary office space. With the execution of the plan, there was no material interruption to the company’s business or its ability to provide services to its customers—indicating a successful implementation of the business continuity plan.
