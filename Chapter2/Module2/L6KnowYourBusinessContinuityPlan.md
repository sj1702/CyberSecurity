Know Your Business Continuity Plan
How often should an organization test its business continuity plan (BCP)? (D2, L2.2.1) 
 A. Annually
 B. Continually
 C. Routinely
 D. Daily
Correct answer: C

The correct answer is C—Routinely. Each individual organization must determine how often to test its BCP, but it should be tested at predefined intervals as well as when significant changes happen within the business environment. Answer A—Annually—is incorrect because it is too specific—not every organization needs to test its BCP every year. Answer B—Continually—is incorrect because it is too vague and does not specify a minimum timeframe for review. Answer D—Daily—is incorrect because testing the BCP daily is too often for most organizations.
