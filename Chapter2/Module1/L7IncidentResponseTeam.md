Incident Response Team
Along with the organizational need to establish a Security Operations Center (SOC) is the need to create a suitable incident response team. A properly staffed and trained incident response team can be leveraged, dedicated or a combination of the two, depending on the requirements of the organization. 

Many IT professionals are classified as first responders for incidents. They are the first ones on the scene and know how to differentiate typical IT problems from security incidents. They are similar to medical first responders who have the skills and knowledge to provide medical assistance at accident scenes and help get the patients to medical facilities when necessary. The medical first responders have specific training to help them determine the difference between minor and major injuries. Further, they know what to do when they come across a major injury. 

Similarly, IT professionals need specific training so they can determine the difference between a typical problem that needs troubleshooting and a security incident that they need to report and address at a higher level. 

A typical incident response team is a cross-functional group of individuals who represent the management, technical and functional areas of responsibility most directly impacted by a security incident. Potential team members include the following:

Representative(s) of senior management
Information security professionals
Legal representatives
Public affairs/communications representatives
Engineering representatives (system and network)

Team members should have training on incident response and the organizationâ€™s incident response plan. Typically, team members assist with investigating the incident, assessing the damage, collecting evidence, reporting the incident and initiating recovery procedures. They would also participate in the remediation and lessons learned stages and help with root cause analysis.

Many organizations now have a dedicated team responsible for investigating any computer security incidents that take place. These teams are commonly known as computer incident response teams (CIRTs) or computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs). When an incident occurs, the response team has four primary responsibilities:

Determine the amount and scope of damage caused by the incident.
Determine whether any confidential information was compromised during the incident.
Implement any necessary recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage.
Supervise the implementation of any additional security measures necessary to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.
