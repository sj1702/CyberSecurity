Narrator: How do you recognize an incident and then identify the first response? Until an analysis has been performed, you cannot. Organizations with mature security programs will have defined procedures. For example, employees tasked with detecting suspicious activity will ascertain the facts and relay them to the organization’s security office or response team.

Let us look at the response to a malware alert. First, a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst receives an alert of anomalous behavior at a workstation. Since the alert is for only one workstation, the SOC Analyst begins triaging the event. Further investigation shows that the alert was for behavior by a known user that did not pose a threat to the organization.

However, had the event involved software that is explicitly not allowed by the organization, the incident response plan would include escalation to a manager to address noncompliance with company policy. Further, if the event involved more than one computer, it might require escalation to a network or systems team to help isolate the event. If the event escalates further, additional teams such as executive management or public relations, or even law enforcement, might need to be involved. 

These are just a few examples of how a simple event could escalate and involve other teams. The organization’s incident response procedure should be scalable from a single event to events causing system-wide outages, with appropriate personnel levels defined in the plan.


What happens with the incident response plan at this point?
 A. The incident response plan continues to be followed.
 B. The incident response plan terminates at this point.
 
 
The correct answer is B. At this point, the incident response plan terminates because the SOC Analyst responded to the event, and it was determined that a known user did not pose a threat. However, had the event involved software that is explicitly not allowed by the organization, the incident response plan would include escalation to a manager to address noncompliance with company policy. Further, if the event involved more than one computer, it might require escalation to a network or systems team to help isolate the event. If the event escalates further, additional teams such as executive management or public relations, or even law enforcement, might need to be involved. These are just a few examples of how a simple event could escalate and involve other teams. The organization’s incident response procedure should be scalable from a single event to events causing system-wide outages, with appropriate personnel levels defined in the plan.
