Components of the Incident Response Plan
The incident response policy should reference an incident response plan that all employees will follow, depending on their role in the process. The plan may contain several procedures and standards related to incident response. It is a living representation of an organization’s incident response policy.

The organization’s vision, strategy and mission should shape the incident response process. Procedures to implement the plan should define the technical processes, techniques, checklists and other tools that teams will use when responding to an incident.

To prepare for incidents, here are the components commonly found in an incident response plan:



Preparation --> Detection and Analysis <--> Containment, Eradication and Recovery -->Post Incident Recovery --> Preparation
