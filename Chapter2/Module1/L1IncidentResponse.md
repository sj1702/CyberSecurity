Incident Terminology
While security professionals strive to protect systems from malicious attacks or human carelessness, inevitably, despite these efforts, things go wrong. For this reason, security professionals also play the role of first responders. An understanding of incident response starts with knowing the terms used to describe various cyberattacks.


Tab 1: Breach

The loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence where: a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information; or an authorized user accesses personally identifiable information for other than an authorized purpose. Source: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5

Tab 2: Event

Any observable occurrence in a network or system. (Source: NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2)

Tab 3: Exploit

A particular attack. It is named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerabilities.

Tab 4: Incident

An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores or transmits.

Tab 5: Intrusion

A security event, or combination of events, that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization. Source: (IETF RFC 4949 Ver 2)

Tab 6: Threat

Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information and/or denial of service. Source: NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1

Tab 7: Vulnerability

Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1

Tab 8: Zero Day

A previously unknown system vulnerability with the potential of exploitation without risk of detection or prevention because it does not, in general, fit recognized patterns, signatures or methods.

What does incident response in cybersecurity look like? No 911 calls have reported an incident. No ambulances or fire engines are coming to the rescue. It's up to the cybersecurity professionals to detect and respond to incidents.
