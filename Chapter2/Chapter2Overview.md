This chapter focuses on the availability part of the CIA triad and the importance of maintaining availability of both human and system resources. These are usually accomplished through the implementation of Incident Response, Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) plans. While these three plans may seem to overlap in scope, they are three distinct plans that are vital to the survival of any organization.

Here are the primary things to remember in this chapter: first, the Incident Response plan responds to unexpected changes in operating conditions to keep the business operating; second, the Business Continuity plan enables the business to continue operating throughout the crisis; and finally, if both the Incident Response and Business Continuity plans fail, the Disaster Recovery plan is activated to help the business to return to normal operations as quickly as possible.

Health and Human Safety
When it comes to a career in cybersecurity, the day-to-day focus is monitoring information systems and looking out for abnormal network activity, malicious software and threat actors. Security professionals spend their days ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and data, but in addition to safeguarding networks and securing the exchange of data and shared resources, it’s important to realize that cybersecurity goes beyond the technical aspects. Its scope encompasses the protection of people and their personal information. There is nothing more important than the health and safety of our users, coworkers and customers.
