Components of a Disaster Recovery Plan
Depending on the size of the organization and the number of people involved in the DRP effort, organizations often maintain multiple types of plan documents, intended for different audiences. The following list includes various types of documents worth considering:

Executive summary providing a high-level overview of the plan
Department-specific plans
Technical guides for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems
Full copies of the plan for critical disaster recovery team members
Checklists for certain individuals:
Critical disaster recovery team members will have checklists to help guide their actions amid the chaotic atmosphere of a disaster.
IT personnel will have technical guides helping them get the alternate sites up and running. 
Managers and public relations personnel will have simple-to-follow, high-level documents to help them communicate the issue accurately without requiring input from team members who are busy working on the recovery.
