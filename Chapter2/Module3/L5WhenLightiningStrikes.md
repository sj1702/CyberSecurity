Manny: During a bad lightning storm last night, JavaSip experienced a power surge that damaged the company computer. Sandra: (Groaning) Oh, I can't believe it. The power surge killed the computer. It won't even turn on. Now what are we going to do? Keith: Seems like we need a new computer. Sandra: Well, that's the least of our worries. What about everything that's on the computer? Everything we need to run this coffee shop is on the computer. Keith: It's okay, Mom. Remember? As part of our disaster recovery plan, Nate and I have been backing up the system every night after we close. Sandra: Are you serious? You have everything backed up? Keith: Everything. It's all on an external hard drive that we take home every night after we close. Sandra: (Laughing) Thank goodness. I'm so proud of you. See, we need you here at JavaSip. Keith: Aw, thanks, Mom. Glad I can help. It's just too bad I couldn't predict a power surge that'd impact the business like this. But look, you go get a new computer and get a surge protector while you're at it. Sandra: I agree. We do not want anything like this to ever happen again. Keith: I'll call Nate. He'll bring the backup, and we'll upload and restore everything up until last night. Sandra: Okay.
