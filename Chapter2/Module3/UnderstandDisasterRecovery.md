Manny: No matter how good the incident response and business continuity plans are, it seems likely that some lasting damage is going to be done. Some data is going to be lost or some services delayed. How do we get things back to normal? Tasha: That's where disaster recovery comes in. It picks up where business continuity left off. We discussed in the last module that business continuity is about maintaining critical business functions. These functions often rely on IT systems and communications. Disaster recovery planning is about restoring IT and communications back to full operation after a disruption, which we'll learn more about in this module.
