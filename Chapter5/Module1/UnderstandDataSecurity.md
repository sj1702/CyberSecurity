Hardening is the process of applying secure configurations (to reduce the attack surface) and locking down various hardware, communications systems and software, including the operating system, web server, application server and applications, etc. In this module, we will introduce configuration management practices that will ensure systems are installed and maintained according to industry and organizational security standards. 


Manny: It's hard to imagine the sheer volume of data that's flying around the world right now. Tasha: Right, and information security, as a process and discipline, provides a structure for protecting the value of data. As an organization creates, stores, shares, uses, modifies, archives, and finally destroys that data.  Manny: Writing information down on paper, a whiteboard, or a flash drive, or putting it in a file on Cloud creates data that is a tangible asset. The organization has to protect both the ideas and the data.  Tasha: Yes, and all the copies of it in papers, books, conversation logs, computer files, database records and the network packets which help move that information from one location or user to another.  Manny: Wow, that's an important job.  Tasha: It sure is.
