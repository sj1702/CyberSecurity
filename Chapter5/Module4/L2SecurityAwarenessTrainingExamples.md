Security Awareness Training Examples
Let’s look at an example of security awareness training by using an organization’s strategy to improve fire safety in the workplace: 

	- Education may help workers in a secure server room understand the interaction of the various fire and smoke detectors, suppression systems, alarms and their interactions with electrical power, lighting and ventilation systems. 
	- Training would provide those workers with task-specific, detailed learning about the proper actions each should take in the event of an alarm, a suppression system going off without an alarm, a ventilation system failure or other contingency. This training would build on the learning acquired via the educational activities. 
	- Awareness activities would include not only posting the appropriate signage, floor or doorway markings, but also other indicators to help workers detect an anomaly, respond to an alarm and take appropriate action. In this case, awareness is a constantly available reminder of what to do when the alarms go off. 
	
	
Translating that into an anti-phishing campaign might be done by: 
	- Education may be used to help select groups of users better understand the ways in which social engineering attacks are conducted and engage those users in creating and testing their own strategies for improving their defensive techniques. 
	- Training will help users increase their proficiency in recognizing a potential phishing or similar attempt, while also helping them practice the correct responses to such events. Training may include simulated phishing emails sent to users on a network to test their ability to identify a phishing email.
	- Raising users’ overall awareness of the threat posed by phishing, vishing, SMS phishing (also called “smishing) and other social engineering tactics. Awareness techniques can also alert selected users to new or novel approaches that such attacks might be taking. 
	
	
Let’s look at some common risks and why it’s important to include them in your security awareness training programs. 

- Phishing:
	The use of phishing attacks to target individuals, entire departments and even companies is a significant threat that the security professional needs to be aware of and be prepared to defend against. Countless variations on the basic phishing attack have been developed in recent years, leading to a variety of attacks that are deployed relentlessly against individuals and networks in a never-ending stream of emails, phone calls, spam, instant messages, videos, file attachments and many other delivery mechanisms.

	Phishing attacks that attempt to trick highly placed officials or private individuals with sizable assets into authorizing large fund wire transfers to previously unknown entities are known as whaling attacks .


- Social Engineering:
	Social engineering is an important part of any security awareness training program for one very simple reason: bad actors know that it works. For the cyberattackers, social engineering is an inexpensive investment with a potentially very high payoff. Social engineering, applied over time, can extract significant insider knowledge about almost any organization or individual.

	One of the most important messages to deliver in a security awareness program is an understanding of the threat of social engineering. People need to be reminded of the threat and types of social engineering so that they can recognize and resist a social engineering attack.

	Most social engineering techniques are not new. Many have even been taught as basic fieldcraft for espionage agencies and are part of the repertoire of investigative techniques used by real and fictional police detectives. A short list of the tactics that we see across cyberspace currently includes:

		- Phone phishing or vishing: Using a rogue interactive voice response (IVR) system to re-create a legitimate-sounding copy of a bank or other institution’s IVR system. The victim is prompted through a phishing email to call in to the “bank” via a provided phone number to verify information such as account numbers, account access codes or a PIN and to confirm answers to security questions, contact information and addresses. A typical vishing system will reject logins continually, ensuring the victim enters PINs or passwords multiple times, often disclosing several different passwords. More advanced systems may be used to transfer the victim to a human posing as a customer service agent for further questioning.
		- Pretexting: The human equivalent of phishing, where someone impersonates an authority figure or a trusted individual in an attempt to gain access to your login information. The pretexter may claim to be an IT support worker who is supposed to do maintenance or an investigator performing a company audit. Or they might impersonate a coworker, the police, a tax authority or some other seemingly legitimate person. The goal is to gain access to your computer and information.
		- Quid pro quo: A request for your password or login credentials in exchange for some compensation, such as a “free gift,” a monetary payment or access to an online game or service. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
		- Tailgating: The practice of following an authorized user into a restricted area or system. The low-tech version of tailgating would occur when a stranger asks you to hold the door open behind you because they forgot their company RFID card. In a more sophisticated version, someone may ask to borrow your phone or laptop to perform a simple action when he or she is actually installing malicious software onto your device.
		
	Social engineering works because it plays on human tendencies. Education, training and awareness work best to counter or defend against social engineering because they help people realize that every person in the organization plays a role in information security.
	
- Password Protection
	We use many different passwords and systems. Many password managers will store a user’s passwords for them so the user does not have to remember all their passwords for multiple systems. The greatest disadvantage of these solutions is the risk of compromise of the password manager.

	These password managers may be protected by a weak password or passphrase chosen by the user and easily compromised. There have been many cases where a person’s private data was stored by a cloud provider but easily accessed by unauthorized persons through password compromise.

	Organizations should encourage the use of different passwords for different systems and should provide a recommended password management solution for its users.

	Examples of poor password protection that should be avoided are:

		- Reusing passwords for multiple systems, especially using the same password for business and personal use.
		- Writing down passwords and leaving them in unsecured areas.
		- Sharing a password with tech support or a co-worker.
		
		
		

Password Advice and Examples:
Narrator: Going back to the subject of the password. If you have a 10-number password, then with software with the cryptographic calculation to brute force attack your environment, it will take 5 seconds to crack. Most people think 8 characters with multiple different characters is pretty secure, and that’s kind of standard for password requirements. But if someone really wants it, it may take them 35 days. We’d rather be more secure than that.   If you have 16 characters with one upper case and one special character, for example, this is more secure, because you have upper and lowercase characters and special characters. To crack this, it will take about 152,000 years.   So just by following a good password policy and appropriate procedures, we can improve our password security immensely.   



Best Practices of Security Awareness Training:
Narrator: We have to make sure we have appropriate communications about current and potential threats to keep awareness high. We could even encourage friendly competition between departments to spot the most phishing attempts. We can offer friendly reminders, like a little squishy stress ball that says, “Lock your computer.” There are also automatic systems that lock the computer automatically when you step away.   It is important to make sure we get positive feedback about our training, ensuring it is appropriate and understood. Make sure the organization’s leaders understand the importance of training and working to promote and improve the information security environment of the organization. And provide the opportunity for personnel to practice what they’ve learned, with exercises and simulations. Occasionally send simulated phishing emails, for example, and give them positive feedback for reporting it.  Depending on the organization’s culture and risk profile, awareness training should be a positive experience for everyone and not punitive unless it is absolutely necessary.
