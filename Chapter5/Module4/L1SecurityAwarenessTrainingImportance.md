Purpose

The purpose of awareness training is to make sure everyone knows what is expected of them, based on responsibilities and accountabilities, and to find out if there is any carelessness or complacency that may pose a risk to the organization. We will be able to align the information security goals with the organization’s missions and vision and have a better sense of what the environment is.  


What is Security Awareness Training?
Let’s start with a clear understanding of the three different types of learning activities that organizations use, whether for information security or for any other purpose:

	- Education: The overall goal of education is to help learners improve their understanding of these ideas and their ability to relate them to their own experiences and apply that learning in useful ways.
	- Training: Focuses on building proficiency in a specific set of skills or actions, including sharpening the perception and judgment needed to make decisions as to which skill to use, when to use it and how to apply it. Training can focus on low-level skills, an entire task or complex workflows consisting of many tasks.
	- Awareness: These are activities that attract and engage the learner’s attention by acquainting them with aspects of an issue, concern, problem or need.
	
You’ll notice that none of these have an expressed or implied degree of formality, location or target audience. (Think of a newly hired senior executive with little or no exposure to the specific compliance needs your organization faces; first, someone has to get their attention and make them aware of the need to understand. The rest can follow.)


The One That Got Away
Gabriela: So, something really weird happened. I got a text this morning saying that I won $1000 from Amazon. Keith: Wow. Did you respond? Gabriela: Well, I was going to, but then at the last minute I noticed that it was from Amazoon, not Amazon. I mean, a company wouldn't misspell its own name, would it? And then it got me thinking about that one time that I accidentally downloaded a virus, and I thought that I would just wait to talk to you about it, since I know you've been studying cybersecurity and phishing and all that. Keith: Congrats You passed. That was a fake link I sent you to see if you would click on it. Gabriela: (sighs) Well, I guess that security awareness training you've been doing has finally paid off. But I still kind of feel like someone owes me $1,000. (People chattering) Tasha: Susan arrives at the coffee shop in time to hear Keith and Gabrielle's conversation. (People chattering) Susan: Well, look at how far you've come since we first started talking about cybersecurity. Keith: Well, at first I figured I didn't have the technical skills. Susan: Ah, but what it really comes down to is you have curiosity, and you're a good communicator, and you work well as part of a team. You're also analytical. You're good at identifying patterns, you know, seeing the bigger picture, but also the smaller details. You are actually perfect for cybersecurity work. Keith: I guess it is pretty interesting, understanding data and how to keep people's data safe. Susan: And it's always changing. There are so many opportunities in this field and different directions you can take. I'm proud to say that I am a System Security Certified Practitioner, and I'm even thinking about earning my CISSP from (ISC)2. Keith: What's that? Susan: It's a Certified Information System Security Professional, a globally recognized cybersecurity certification. Keith: Wow, that is so cool. It seems like cybersecurity never gets boring or stale. I'd always be growing, unlike here. Susan: Hey, do not let your mom hear you say that. she has coffee running in her veins. Keith: Gabriela can take over for me, right? I mean, you know more about customers' data and how to keep it safe. Gabriela: I mean, that would be great, Keith, but I might consider a future in cybersecurity myself. Keith: I'm ready to start now. What do I need to do to get a job like yours? Susan: I might just be able to point you in the right direction. What have we got here? Keith: Oh, we're working on... 

The Importance of Security Training:
Narrator: Why does everyone need security training? The weakest link in any organization is the human, and each one of us, regardless of if we are the new intern or the executive in the corner office, each one of us has our own responsibilities about security. Everyone contributes to improving the security environment, administratively, physically and technically.

Employees cannot follow policies and procedures if they have not received training on what the policies and procedures are. This is especially important for topics like data handling and emergency response activities. For instance: fire drills are crucial to protect health and human safety, and train users how to implement the process of protecting themselves from danger. 


Why is security training important?
 A. Because it reduces the risk of certain types of attacks, like social engineering.
 B. Because it fulfills regulatory requirements.
 C. Because it helps people to perform their job duties more efficiently.
The correct answer is A. Security training is important because it reduces the risk of certain types of attacks, like social engineering. When employees and staff are prepared to recognize security problems and know how to operate securely, then the organization is in a better security position.
