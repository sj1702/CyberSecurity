Module Objective
L5.3.1 Explain the application of common security policies.
An organization’s security policies define what “security” means to that organization, which in almost all cases reflects the tradeoff between security, operability, affordability and potential risk impacts. Security policies express or impose behavioral or other constraints on the system and its use. Well-designed systems operating within these constraints should reduce the potential of security breaches to an acceptable level. 

Security governance that does not align properly with organizational goals can lead to implementation of security policies and decisions that unnecessarily inhibit productivity, impose undue costs and hinder strategic intent.

In this module, we'll explore the most common security policies found in organizations and identify some components of these policies.
