Change Management Components
The change management process includes the following components:

	- Request For Change:
	All of the major change management practices address a common set of core activities that start with a request for change (RFC) and move through various development and test stages until the change is released to the end users. From first to last, each step is subject to some form of formalized management and decision-making; each step produces accounting or log entries to document its results. 
	
	- Approval:
	These processes typically include: Evaluating the RFCs for completeness, Assignment to the proper change authorization process based on risk and organizational practices, Stakeholder reviews, resource identification and allocation, Appropriate approvals or rejections, and Documentation of approval or rejection.
	
	- Rollback:
	Depending upon the nature of the change, a variety of activities may need to be completed. These generally include: Scheduling the change, Testing the change, Verifying the rollback procedures, Implementing the change, Evaluating the change for proper and effective operation, and Documenting the change in the production environment. Rollback authority would generally be defined in the rollback plan, which might be immediate or scheduled as a subsequent change if monitoring of the change suggests inadequate performance.
	
	
	
Change Management Components in the Workplace
Narrator: Change management happens in a cycle. There is no real stopping point; it is continuously going. This means that there must be continuous monitoring of that environment. So, if you or anyone should request a change, it needs to go through the appropriate approvals. The organization must be prepared for rollback if necessary, meaning that if that particular change did not work, we need to be able to roll back to the legacy system.  While change management is an organization-wide process, it often falls on Information Security professionals to coordinate the effort and maybe to provide oversight and governance. Depending on the size of the organization, it may also fall under an IT or development area. In organizations that have a quality or risk management department, it would be a great fit in either of those areas too. The common theme is that change management acknowledges and incorporates input from the end users as well as all areas of IT, Development, Information Security and most importantly Management, to ensure that all changes are properly tested, approved and communicated prior to being implemented. 



True or False? A privacy policy protects PII/ePHI from disclosure? (D5, L5.3.1) 
 True
 False
Correct answer: True

It’s true. A privacy policy documents how the organization’s personnel will handle personally identifiable information (PII), which is also referred to as electronic protected health information [ePHI] in the health industry, to ensure that it complies with any relevant national and international laws, such as the GDPR in the EU and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada; laws for specific industries in certain countries such as HIPAA and Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) in the U.S.; or local laws in which the organization operates.





For what purpose is a process required with a change management policy? (D5, L5.3.1) 
A. To define the standards for using the organization’s network and computer systems.
Incorrect. An acceptable use policy (AUP) defines acceptable use of the organization’s network, not a change management policy.

B. To help protect the organization in the event it faces legal action.
Incorrect. The acceptable use, privacy, BOYD and data handling policies help to protect the organization from legal action.

C. To establish the appropriate use of the organization’s data.
Incorrect. The data handling policy defines whether data is for use within the company, is restricted for use by only certain roles or can be made public to anyone outside the organization.

D. To ensure that systems changes are done without adversely affecting business operations.
Correct. Change management requires a process to implement necessary changes so they do not adversely affect business operations.




Supporting Security Policies with Procedures
Narrator: Different organizations will have different goals for their acceptable use policies. Some organizations encourage employees to make wide personal use of the organization’s IT assets, to improve morale and reduce interruptions between the user’s personal life and work. Some organizations encourage users to use organizational assets to perform personal educational tasks, as well—this way, the employee gets the benefit of the assets, and the organization gets a higher-trained and happier employee. Some organizations severely limit users' personal use of IT assets, in order to reduce risk within the organization.  All security related policies should align with the organization’s risk tolerance while ensuring that regulatory requirements are met.  An organization that does not store confidential data on a laptop or workstation is likely to be more relaxed in their acceptable use policy, while a healthcare facility, research institution or defense contractor may be much stricter, as they have data that can be potentially devastating if compromised.
