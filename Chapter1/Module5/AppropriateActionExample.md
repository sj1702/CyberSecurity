Cranz is an ISC2 member and an employee of Triffid Corporation. One of Cranz’s colleagues offers to share a file that contains an illicit copy of a newly released movie. What should Cranz do? 


 A. Inform ISC2
Incorrect. The ISC2 Code of Ethics requires that members “act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally.” The Code, however, does not require that members report violations to ISC2.

 B. Accept the movie
Incorrect. The ISC2 Code of Ethics requires that members “act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally.” Accepting or participating in the distribution of intellectual property owned by someone else would be counter to this Canon, and it would also go against the Canon requiring that ISC2 members “advance and protect the profession.”

 C. Refuse to accept
Correct. The ISC2 Code of Ethics requires that members “act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally.” Accepting or participating in the distribution of intellectual property owned by someone else would be counter to this Canon, and it would also go against the Canon requiring that ISC2 members “advance and protect the profession.”

 D. Inform law enforcement
Incorrect. The ISC2 Code of Ethics requires that members “act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally.” The Code, however, does not require that members act as law enforcement agents, so Cranz is not required to report the matter to law enforcement, or to ISC2.
