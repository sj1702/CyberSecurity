Threats
A threat is a person or thing that takes action to exploit (or make use of) a target organizationâ€™s system vulnerabilities, as part of achieving or furthering its goal or objectives. To better understand threats, consider the following scenario:

Narrator: Tourists are popular targets for pickpockets.  The existence of pickpockets in a crowded tourist spot is a threat to the people gathered there. That threat applies to everyone in the vicinity, even other pickpockets. If you are in the vicinity and the pickpocket has identified you as a target, you are facing a threat actor whether you know it or not.  The approach and technique taken by the pickpocket is their threat vector.  

In the context of cybersecurity, typical threat actors include the following:

Insiders (either deliberately, by simple human error, or by gross incompetence).
Outside individuals or informal groups (either planned or opportunistic, discovering vulnerability).
Formal entities that are nonpolitical (such as business competitors and cybercriminals).
Formal entities that are political (such as terrorists, nation-states, and hacktivists).
Intelligence or information gatherers (could be any of the above).
Technology (such as free-running bots and artificial intelligence , which could be part of any of the above).
*Threat Vector: The means by which a threat actor carries out their objectives.
