Domain D1.2.1, D1.2.2

Module Objectives
L1.2.1 Define risk management terminology and summarize the process.
L1.2.2 Relate risk management to personal or professional practices.
Risks and security-related issues represent an ongoing concern of businesses as well as the field of cybersecurity, but far too often organizations fail to proactively manage risk. Assessing and analyzing risk should be a continuous and comprehensive exercise in any organization. As a member of an organization’s security team, you will work through risk assessment, analysis, mitigation, remediation and communication.

There are many frameworks and models used to facilitate the risk management process, and each organization makes its own determination of what constitutes risk and the level of risk it is willing to accept. However, there are commonalities among the terms, concepts and skills needed to measure and manage risk. This module gets you started by presenting foundational terminology and introducing you to the risk management process.

First, a definition of  risk  is  a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. It is often expressed as a combination of:

the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs,  and 
the likelihood of occurrence. 
Information security risk reflects the potential adverse impacts that result from the possibility of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information and/or information systems. This definition represents that risk is associated with threats, impact and likelihood, and it also indicates that IT risk is a subset of business risk.
