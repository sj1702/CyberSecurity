Risk Identification
How do you identify risks? Do you walk down the street watching out for traffic and looking for puddles on the ground? Maybe you’ve noticed loose wires at your desk or water on the office floor? If you’re already on the lookout for risks, you’ll fit with other security professionals who know it’s necessary to dig deeper to find possible problems.  

In the world of cyber, identifying risks is not a one-and-done activity. It’s a recurring process of identifying different possible risks, characterizing them and then estimating their potential for disrupting the organization.  

It involves looking at your unique company and analyzing its unique situation. Security professionals know their organization’s strategic, tactical and operational plans.

Takeaways to remember about risk identification: 

Identify risk to communicate it clearly. 
Employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for identifying risk.
Identify risk to protect against it. 
As a security professional, you are likely to assist in risk assessment at a system level, focusing on process, control, monitoring or incident response and recovery activities. If you’re working with a smaller organization, or one that lacks any kind of risk management and mitigation plan and program, you might have the opportunity to help fill that planning void.
