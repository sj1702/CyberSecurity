Risk Management Terminology
Security professionals use their knowledge and skills to examine operational risk management, determine how to use risk data effectively, work cross-functionally and report actionable information and findings to the stakeholders concerned. Terms such as threats, vulnerabilities and assets are familiar to most cybersecurity professionals.

An asset is something in need of protection.
A vulnerability is a gap or weakness in those protection efforts.
A threat is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts.
Risk is the intersection of these terms. Let's look at them more closely.
