Narrator: What do we mean when we say threats and vulnerabilities? A vulnerability is a gap or weakness in an organization’s protection of its valuable assets, including information. A threat is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.  By exploiting a vulnerability, the threat can harm an asset. For example, a natural disaster, such as a major storm, poses a threat to the utility power supply, which is vulnerable to flooding. The IT environment where production takes place is an asset. If the utility power supply is cut off by a storm, the asset might be made unavailable, because the IT components won’t work without power. Our job is to evaluate how likely it is that an event will take place and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk.
