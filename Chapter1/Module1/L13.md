Manny: It's time to check in with our friends at JavaSip. Tasha: Keith has finished his university studies but doesn't know what to do next. He's working at JavaSip because it's convenient. His mother, Sandra, owns the place. Manny: But this is not his dream job. Unfortunately, he has no idea what his dream job may be. Tasha: Let's see what he's thinking about his future. Sandra: I don't know why you're not happy here. This is a great job. It's flexible, you get to meet some interesting people. You get to work with your wonderful mother all day. Keith: Ah, yes, aren't I lucky? Sandra: Someday this could be all yours and Nate's. Keith: Yeah, Nate loves business, and he loves it here. But Mom, I want to do something different. I don't know what it is, but I'll figure it out. Sandra: I know you will, Keith. You are an intelligent young man. In the meantime, I am happy to have you working with us. Keith: Thanks, Mom. Manny: I remember those years. It's hard to know what you want to do when you're young. Tasha: Sometimes it's hard to know what you want when you're older, too. Manny: That's true. If only we could help Keith discover a rewarding career that would suit him. Tasha: Indeed.
