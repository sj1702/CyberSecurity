Narrator: Sometimes, a collection of data might be considered PII, while the distinct data elements, each by itself, would not. For example, a date of birth alone can be shared by many individuals and is not considered PII. However, when combined with a name or other piece of information, it would significantly narrow the possibility of association with more individuals.

Cybersecurity professionals take on the obligation of protecting many kinds of organizational data and personal information. We all have PII, and it needs to be protected. The three elements of the CIA Triad play out in our everyday lives. The next time you go to your physician, open your email or check the balance of your checking account, think about how the people who are entrusted to protect it accomplish this responsibility. It is a different way of thinking, and one you will develop as you progress in your cybersecurity career.

As security professionals, how do we protect this information?
 A. By using the three parts of the CIA triad.
 B. By meeting the privacy requirements of the individual owners of the data.
 
 Option A is Correct. The CIA triad is the cornerstone of information security, and as a security professional you will use all its components—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—to protect the information in your charge. Think of it as a three-dimensional way of thinking. There are many different aspects to protecting information and the more you think about it, the more you realize how complex it can be.
