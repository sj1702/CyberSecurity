Narrator: Regulations and laws can affect the day-to-day operations of many organizations. As we mentioned before, one example of a law with a broad impact is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which affords data protection and control to individuals within the territorial boundaries of the EU regardless of citizenship.  As another example, in the United States, patient medical information is governed by the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and must be closely guarded. From the information security perspective, a high standard of professionalism is expected in safeguarding data on the patients’ behalf. Information security is based on trust and credibility. If something goes wrong, the stakeholders’ trust evaporates, and organizations’ credibility is damaged—sometimes without cure. HIPAA also carries significant criminal and financial penalties for noncompliance for both the organization and the individuals involved.  Fortunately, there are published frameworks, or standards, to guide the organizational policies that support the compliance effort. Many departments or workgroups within the organization implement procedures that detail how they complete day-to-day tasks while remaining compliant. Among these groups is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ISO is an international standards body; one of the standards that ISO publishes is how to destroy data in a secure fashion.
