Narrator: An organization has many tools that can be used to prevent or reduce risks from various threats. Firewalls can be used to prevent many different types of threats from entering the network by filtering network traffic based on rules. Now that you know the function of a firewall, can you identify if traffic would be allowed or denied at the firewall? Let’s look at some tools that help prevent threats and determine if they would make it past a properly configured firewall.

Now that you know which traffic is allowed and denied at the firewall, let us look into the tools that help prevent threats.


Which traffic should be denied or allowed at the firewall? Select allowed or denied for each traffic.
Inbound ICMP traffic

 A. Allowed
 B. Denied
Inbound ICMP traffic is denied at the firewall.





Which traffic should be denied or allowed at the firewall? Select allowed or denied for each traffic.
Inbound traffic with source IP and/or email address from inside the network

 A. Allowed
 B. Denied
Inbound traffic with source IP and/or email address from inside the network is denied at the firewall. Internal traffic is not normally routed through the firewall and could be an indicator of someone spoofing an internal address to gain access.





Which traffic should be denied or allowed at the firewall? Select allowed or denied for each traffic.
Inbound email with no attachments

 A. Allowed
 B. Denied
Inbound email with no attachments is allowed at the firewall. Email without attachments is generally safe to be viewed by the end user. There could still be potentially malicious links if the content of emails is not scanned before entry. However, if all email was blocked, no email would pass through the firewall and would not provide value to the business.








Threats can compromise an organization's network. To reduce the number of threats, organizations use different tools that help identify and prevent threats to an organization’s resources.  

Please answer the following question.  

Which tools help to identify, prevent or both identify and prevent threats? Select identify, prevent or both for each tool. 

1. IDS
   Identify. An Intrusion Detection System helps to identify threats, but does not have the capability to prevent them.
   
2. HIDS
   Identify. A Host Intrusion Detection System helps to identify threats to a host system, but does not prevent them.
   
3. NIDS
   Identify. A Network Intrusion Detection System helps to identify threats based on network traffic, but does not prevent them.
   
4. SIEM
   Identify. A Security Incident and Event Management system identifies threats by correlating and storing logs from multiple systems, but does not take action to prevent the threats from materializing.
   
5. Anti-malware/Antivirus
   Both. Anti-malware/Antivirus helps to both identify and prevent threats by identifying malicious software and stopping the processes before they fully execute.
   
6. Scans
   Identify. Scans help to identify threats, often by conducting a vulnerability analysis, and may suggest action to mitigate the threats, but does not prevent them.
   
7. Firewall
   Both. Most modern firewalls both identify and prevent threats by automatically adjusting rules to block malicious traffic from entering a secured network.
   
8. IPS (NIPS/HIPS)
   Both. Intrusion Prevention Systems both identify and prevent threats.
