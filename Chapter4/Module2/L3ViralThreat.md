Tasha: Before her shift starts, Gabriela attempts to upload a school assignment on her iPad, but the device is not responding.  Gabriela: Ugh, why is nothing working? This stupid thing. I need to turn in this assignment.  Keith: What is it?  Gabriela: It just spins and spins.  Keith: Have you updated recently?  Gabriela: Yes. Keith: Have you clicked on any new links?  Gabriela: Oh, no. That strange email from the other day! It said I won a gift certificate, but when I clicked the link, it didn't go anywhere.  Keith: It's okay. Sounds like you have a virus though. But we can ask Susan for help. Have you backed it up to the cloud?  Gabriela: I have.  Keith: Great, everything will be all right then.
