Managed Service Provider (MSP)
A managed service provider (MSP) is a company that manages information technology assets for another company. Small- and medium-sized businesses commonly outsource part or all of their information technology functions to an MSP to manage day-to-day operations or to provide expertise in areas the company does not have. Organizations may also use an MSP to provide network and security monitoring and patching services. Today, many MSPs offer cloud-based services augmenting SaaS solutions with active incident investigation and response activities. One such example is a managed detection and response (MDR) service, where a vendor monitors firewall and other security tools to provide expertise in triaging events. 

Some other common MSP implementations are: 

Augment in-house staff for projects
Utilize expertise for implementation of a product or service
Provide payroll services
Provide Help Desk service management
Monitor and respond to security incidents
Manage all in-house IT infrastructure 





Service-Level Agreement (SLA)
The cloud computing service-level agreement (cloud SLA) is an agreement between a cloud service provider and a cloud service customer based on a taxonomy of cloud computing– specific terms to set the quality of the cloud services delivered. It characterizes quality of the cloud services delivered in terms of a set of measurable properties specific to cloud computing (business and technical) and a given set of cloud computing roles (cloud service customer, cloud service provider, and related sub-roles).

Think of a rule book and legal contract—that combination is what you have in a service-level agreement (SLA). Let us not underestimate or downplay the importance of this document/ agreement. In it, the minimum level of service, availability, security, controls, processes, communications, support and many other crucial business elements are stated and agreed to by both parties.  

The purpose of an SLA is to document specific parameters, minimum service levels and remedies for any failure to meet the specified requirements. It should also affirm data ownership and specify data return and destruction details. Other important SLA points to consider include the following:

Cloud system infrastructure details and security standards
Customer right to audit legal and regulatory compliance by the CSP         
Rights and costs associated with continuing and discontinuing service use
Service availability
Service performance
Data security and privacy
Disaster recovery processes
Data location
Data access
Data portability
Problem identification and resolution expectations
Change management processes
Dispute mediation processes
Exit strategy 



Which cloud deployment model provides services to only one organization? (D4, L4.3.3) 
 A. Public
Incorrect. A public cloud is shared among many customers.

 B. Private
Correct. A private cloud includes cloud-based assets for a single organization.

 C. Hybrid
Incorrect. A hybrid cloud uses both public and private clouds together.



Which of the following cloud service models provides the most suitable environment for customers to build and operate their own software? (D4. L4.3.3)
 A. SaaS
Incorrect. SaaS provides access to software applications but not the equipment necessary for customers to build and operate their own software.

 B. IaaS
Incorrect. IaaS provides use of hardware and related equipment that is retained by the provider but does not allow customers to build and operate their own software in the most suitable way, since it would also require them to manage the operating systems as well.

 C. PaaS
Correct. PaaS typically provides a set of software building blocks and development tools, such as programming languages and supporting a run-time environment, that facilitate the construction of high-quality, scalable applications.

 D. SLA
Incorrect. SLA is a service-level agreement and is not a cloud service deployment model.
