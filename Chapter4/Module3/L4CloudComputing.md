Cloud
Cloud computing is usually associated with an internet-based set of computing resources, and typically sold as a service, provided by a cloud service provider (CSP). 

Cloud computing is very similar to the electrical or power grid. It is provisioned in a geographic location and is sourced using an electrical means that is not necessarily obvious to the consumer. But when you want electricity, it’s available to you via a common standard interface and you pay only for what you use. In these ways, cloud computing is very similar. It is a very scalable, elastic and easy-to-use “utility” for the provisioning and deployment of Information Technology (IT) services.  

There are various definitions of what cloud computing means according to the leading standards, including NIST. This NIST definition is commonly used around the globe, cited by professionals and others alike to clarify what the term “cloud” means:  

	“a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”  

Cloud computing characteristics, service and deployment models, are as below:
	- There are four types of eployment models of cloud: Public Cloud, private cloud, Hybrid cloud, community cloud
	- Some others are: Multicloud, Poly cloud, Big Data, High Performance Computing Cloud.
	- The three standard service models are: Software as a Service(SaaS), Platform as a Service(PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS).
	- Some other service models are: Mobile Backend as a Service(MBaaS), Serverless Computing or Function as a Service (FaaS). 
	- 
	
	
cloud computing identifies "five essential characteristics":

	-On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
	
	-Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
	
	-Resource pooling. The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
	
	-Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
	
	-Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
	
	
	
	
## Cloud Redundancy:
Narrator: Many organizations have moved from hard-wired server rooms to operations that are run by cloud-based facilities, because it provides both security and flexibility. Cloud service providers have different availability zones, so that if one goes down, activities can shift to another. You don’t have to maintain a whole data center with all the redundancy that entails – the cloud service provider does that for you.  There are several ways to contract with a cloud service provider. You can set up the billing so that it depends on the data used, just like your mobile phone. And you have resource pooling, meaning you can share in the resources of other colleagues or similar types of industries to provide data for artificial intelligence or analytics.
